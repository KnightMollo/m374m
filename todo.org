* TODOs
** TODO Fix unaligned figures
I manually tuned the figures in the past, but that's getting really annoying and
time consuming. The =subcaption= package should've solved this but I still don't
have a best-known method. Maybe =minipage=?
** TODO Simplify documents
Some of the code in the homeworks is just nasty. I should clean it up.
** TODO Clean up notes
Please do this before the final... This will also help make the cheat sheets and
understand the content.
** TODO Add notes figures
Will I ever get to this? There are so many figures...
** TODO Separate homework macros and notes macros
Homework subsections need new pages, but notes subsections do not.
** TODO Template-ize homework start and end
