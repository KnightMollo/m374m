\subsection{3}
\subsubsection*{Problem}
For the system
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    x'&=y^2 \\
    y'&=-\frac{2}{3}x, \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
find critical points, nullclines, and the direction of the orbits in the regions
separated by the nullclines. Next,find the equations of the orbits and plot the
phase diagram. Is the origin stable or unstable?
\subsubsection*{Solution}
\todo[]

\subsection{5$^2$}
\subsubsection*{Problem}
Find the linearization of the system
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    x'&=y-x \\
    y'&=-y+\frac{5x^2}{4+x^2} \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
about the equilibrium point $(1,1)$. Draw the nullclines and indicate the
direction of the orbits in each region separated by the nullclines. Can you
conclude anything baout the stability of the critical point?

\subsection{5$^2$}
\subsubsection*{Problem}
At time $t=0$ a chemical herbicide is sprayed on a soil in a field of crops. Let
$x$ be the amount of herbicide in the crop, and let $y$ be the amount of
herbicide in the soil. Suppose herbicide is transferred from the soil to the
crop at rate $\beta y$ and transferred from the crop to the soil at rate $\alpha
x$; further, assume that the chemical degrades in the soil at rate $\gamma y$.
Set up a modelfor the amounts of herbicide int he crop and in soil. Sketch a
phase plane diagram indicating how the system evolves in time.
